## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This work is aim to gain insight from coffee sales data. The dataset covers sales from 2019 to 2022. I created a dashboard which summarizes core thing needs to be focused on. 

## FUNCTION USED 
The data in csv (Comma Separated Value) form with three worksheets. They are "orders" , "customer" and "products". These worksheets have some common feature (columns) which can be shared to get new columns. The following are functions used in the project :-  

<b>Vlookup</b> - I used this function for maching country from "orders" worksheet to "customers" worksheet.

      =VLOOKUP(C2,customers!$A$2:$G$1001,7,FALSE)
      
<b>IndexMatch</b> - This one is nested function. used to get coffetype from "preoducts" worksheet to "orders" worksheet.

      =INDEX(products!$A$1:$G$49,MATCH(orders!$D2,products!$A$3:$A$49,0),MATCH(orders!I$1,products!$A$1:$G$1,0))
